# project-duplication-detection-system
This is a project detection duplication system created using visual basic 6.0, I Know VB6 right,
But this was created due to the fact some schools can't let go of this very old technology and teach it to students,
they should just make a history of programming class where old stuff can be taught and the students be given a choice
to learn it or not.

I added a Microsoft system development enviroment because it was missing in my system and this might not be necessary for you 
so make sure to delete it 'MSDE.dll'

All credits to 'inettutor.com' for most of the code written.
